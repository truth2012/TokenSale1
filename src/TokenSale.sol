//
// This contract is a simplified version of a real contract which
// was audited by Cyfrin in a private audit and contained the same bugs.
//
// Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find those bugs!
//
// This contract allows the creator to invite a select group of people
// to participate in a token sale. Users can exchange an allowed token
// for the token being sold. This could be used by a DAO to distribute
// their governance token in exchange for DAI, but having a lot more control
// over how that distribution takes place compared to using a uniswap pool.
//
// This contract has been intentionally simplified to remove much of
// the extra complexity in order to help you find the particular bugs without
// other distractions. Please read the comments carefully as they note
// specific findings that are excluded as the implementation has been
// purposefully kept simple to help you focus on finding the harder
// to find and more interesting bugs.
//
// This contract intentionally has no time-out period for the token sale
// to complete; lack of a time-out period resulting in the token sale never
// completing is not a valid finding as this has been intentionally
// omitted to simplify the codebase.
//
// This contract intentionally does not support fee-on-transfer, rebasing
// ERC777 or any non-standard, weird ERC20s. It only supports ERC20s
// that conform to the ERC20 implementation. Any findings related to
// weird/non-standard ERC20s are invalid. Any findings related to blacklists are invalid.
//
// This contract intentionally has no rescue function; any tokens that
// are sent to this contract are lost forever. Once this contract is
// created the fixed amount of tokens to be sold can't be changed. Any
// findings related to these issues are invalid.
//
// This contract should only contain 2 intentional High findings, but
// if you find others they were not intentional :-) This contract should
// not be used in any live/production environment; it is purely an
// educational bug-hunting exercise based on a real-world example.
